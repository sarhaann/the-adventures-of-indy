Looks like a residual spur between converging streams.\\n   \u2022 Feature match: Does not form an enclosed shape or consistent ditch/ridge pair.\\n   \u2022 Topographic context: DEM shows this sits on a mid-slope knoll protruding into a valley; typical for erosional remnant.\\n   \u2022 Alternative explanation: Natural interfluve spur.\\n   \u2022 Classification: NATURAL.\\n\\n2. East-central straightish ridge\\n   \u2022 Geometric test: Approximately straight for ~150 m but tapers and meanders at both ends; no paired ditch.\\n   \u2022 Feature match: Could resemble a causeway but lacks parallel sides or terminal mounds.\\n   \u2022 Context: Occurs on valley sidewall, following contour; likely a natural terrace or levee.\\n   \u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY (natural).\\n\\n3.

Your task is to analyze a Z-score elevation anomaly map for signs of earthworks, mounds, or geoglyphs.\n\nYou will be provided with two images:\n1. Z-score elevation anomaly map: This map is calculated using a 50m local neighborhood window. Each pixel shows how many standard deviations (\u00b14\u03c3 clipped) the elevation differs from the local mean. Red indicates elevated terrain (mounds, platforms), blue indicates depressed terrain (ditches, quarries), and white represents typical elevation.\n\n2. Terrain colormap DEM: A visualization of absolute elevation using a terrain color scheme where brown/tan indicates higher elevations, green represents mid-elevations, and blue shows lower elevations or water features. This provides topographic context for understanding the landscape setting.\n\n## Using Both Images:\n- The Z-score map is your primary tool for identifying anomalies\n- Reference the terrain colormap to understand landscape position (upland plateaus for geoglyphs, elevated areas for ring ditches)\n- Identify proximity to water features or floodplains\n\n## Analysis Protocol\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Survey\n\nDocument the 3-5 most prominent anomalies without interpretation:\n- Location (quadrant: NW, NE, SW, SE, or center)\n- Basic shape (circular, linear, rectangular, irregular)\n- Relative prominence (which stands out most)\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Each Anomaly\n\nStarting with the most prominent, evaluate each anomaly:\n\nGeometric Test:\n- Is it a clear geometric shape (circle, polygon, straight line)?\n- Are the edges consistent and regular?\n- Is there symmetry or regular angles?\n- Any paired features (ridge+ditch)?\n- If clearly natural pattern (meandering, dendritic drainage), classify as natural and move to Phase 3\n\nFeature Match:\n- Enclosed shapes (circles/polygons): geoglyphs or ring ditches\n- Straight lines: causeways or roads\n- Clustered dots: mound villages\n- Parallel lines: raised fields\n\nAnalysis:\n- Internal consistency: Are all parts of the feature coherent?\n- Topographic context: Using the terrain colormap, what is the landscape setting? (plateau, valley, slope, floodplain)\n- Classification confidence: How well does it match known archaeological features?\n- Alternative explanations: Could natural processes explain this?\n\nClassification:\nBased on the analysis, classify as:\n- HIGH CONFIDENCE: Perfect geometry, clear archaeological feature\n- PROBABLE: Good geometry, matches known types\n- UNLIKELY: Weak geometry, could be natural\n- NATURAL: No geometric pattern or clearly natural origin\n\n### Phase 3: Iterate\nRepeat Phase 2 for each prominent anomaly until all are analyzed.\n\n### Phase 4: Final Assessment\nReview all anomalies together:\n- Do any connect or align?\n- Is there an organized pattern?\n- What type of site might this be?\n- Are there any that distinctly stand out and are prominent?\n\n## Output Format\n\nUse the tool `finish_analysis` with:\n\n1. analysis: A structured summary including analysis on each anomaly with its individual classification, relationship patterns observed (if any), and overall site interpretation.\n2. confidence_score (0-10): Your archaeological assessment\n\n0-2: Natural features only\n3-5: Inconclusive (weak geometric hints)\n6-8: Probable archaeological site\n9-10: Definite archaeological site\n",

This provides topographic context for understanding the landscape setting.\n\n## Using Both Images:\n- The Z-score map is your primary tool for identifying anomalies\n- Reference the terrain colormap to understand landscape position (upland plateaus for geoglyphs, elevated areas for ring ditches)\n- Identify proximity to water features or floodplains\n\n## Analysis Protocol\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Survey\n\nDocument the 3-5 most prominent anomalies without interpretation:\n- Location (quadrant: NW, NE, SW, SE, or center)\n- Basic shape (circular, linear, rectangular, irregular)\n- Relative prominence (which stands out most)\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze Each Anomaly\n\nStarting with the most prominent, evaluate each anomaly:\n\nGeometric Test:\n- Is it a clear geometric shape (circle, polygon, straight line)?\n- Are the edges consistent and regular?\n- Is there symmetry or regular angles?\n- Any paired features (ridge+ditch)?\n- If clearly natural pattern (meandering, dendritic drainage), classify as natural and move to Phase 3\n\nFeature Match:\n- Enclosed shapes (circles/polygons): geoglyphs or ring ditches\n- Straight lines: causeways or roads\n- Clustered dots: mound villages\n- Parallel lines: raised fields\n\nAnalysis:\n- Internal consistency: Are all parts of the feature coherent?\n- Topographic context: Using the terrain colormap, what is the landscape setting? (plateau, valley, slope, floodplain)\n- Classification confidence: How well does it match known archaeological features?\n- Alternative explanations: Could natural processes explain this?\n\nClassification:\nBased on the analysis, classify as:\n- HIGH CONFIDENCE: Perfect geometry, clear archaeological feature\n- PROBABLE: Good geometry, matches known types\n- UNLIKELY: Weak geometry, could be natural\n- NATURAL: No geometric pattern or clearly natural origin\n\n### Phase 3: Iterate\nRepeat Phase 2 for each prominent anomaly until all are analyzed.\n\n### Phase 4: Final Assessment\nReview all anomalies together:\n- Do any connect or align?\n- Is there an organized pattern?\n- What type of site might this be?\n- Are there any that distinctly stand out and are prominent?\n\n## Output Format\n\nUse the tool `finish_analysis` with:\n\n1. analysis: A structured summary including analysis on each anomaly with its individual classification, relationship patterns observed (if any), and overall site interpretation.\n2. confidence_score (0-10): Your archaeological assessment\n\n0-2: Natural features only\n3-5: Inconclusive (weak geometric hints)\n6-8: Probable archaeological site\n9-10: Definite archaeological site\n",

SW quadrant, ~25 % from left edge & 70 % from top: nearly complete circular blue ring (diameter \u2248300\u2013400 m), interior shows weak red speckling \u2013 stands out clearly against predominantly linear drainage.\\n2. W-central quadrant, just north of #1: incomplete blue arc open toward west, possible remnant of larger circle; lower prominence than #1.\\n3. Centre-east quadrant: narrow, straightish NW-SE trending blue depression \u2248500 m long, flanked by light red shoulders.\\n4. NE quadrant, mid-slope of high plateau: elongate sub-rectangular blue patch (\u2248350 \u00d7 150 m) with parallel long axis E-W.\\n\\nPHASE 2 \u2013 ANOMALY ANALYSIS\\n1. Circular ring \u2013 SW quadrant\\n   \u2022 Geometric test: shape is almost perfectly circular; width of blue band fairly uniform; minor red interior suggest thrown-up spoil/micro-ridge.\\n   \u2022 Paired ditch/ridge is present but very weak.<br>   \u2022 Topographic context: Terrain map shows feature lying on a low, green valley terrace immediately beside an active meandering river (blue). Location coincides with abandoned meander belt.\\n   \u2022 Alternative explanation: Ox-bow lake or infilled palaeo-meander can create near-perfect circles close to a river. Presence beside active channel and lack of other cultural features makes this natural explanation compelling.\\n   \u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY (geomorphological ox-bow more probable).\\n\\n2. Incomplete arc \u2013 W-central\\n   \u2022 Geometry: only ~140\u00b0 of an arc visible; curvature inconsistent, edges diffuse.\\n   \u2022 Context: directly on inside bend of same river meander; clearly tied to fluvial erosion/deposition.\\n   \u2022 Classification: NATURAL (river terrace scarp).\\n\\n3. Straight NW-SE line \u2013 Centre-east\\n   \u2022 Geometry: reasonably straight for ~500 m, but variable width and flanked by branching gullies; lacks parallel pair or terminal features.\\n   \u2022 Context: Lies on down-slope transition (yellow-green) draining plateau to valley; likely a natural erosional gully.\\n   \u2022 Classification: NATURAL.\\n\\n4. Sub-rectangular depression \u2013 NE quadrant\\n   \u2022 Geometry: sides slightly straight but corners rounded, interior floor irregular; edges not sharp.\\n   \u2022 Context: Mid-slope mass-movement hollow on steep tan slope of plateau.\\n   \u2022 Classification: NATURAL (landslide scar or slump hollow).\\n\\nPHASE 3 \u2013 ITERATION\\nAll additional minor red/blue spots inspected show dendritic, meandering or slope-parallel organisation characteristic of natural drainage and mass-movement; no consistent geometric earthworks detected.\\n\\nPHASE 4 \u2013 FINAL ASSESSMENT\\nThe only strongly geometric candidate (#1) is situated directly within a meander belt, perfectly matching the expected position and size of an ox-bow lake. No clusters, alignments or ancillary features (causeways, secondary enclosures, mound scatters) accompany it. Overall pattern of anomalies mirrors natural fluvial and erosional processes.\\n\\nOverall Interpretation: The scene lacks convincing archaeological earthworks or geoglyphs; the observed anomalies are best explained by natural fluvial and slope processes.\\n\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 2\n}",
