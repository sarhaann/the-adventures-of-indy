Widths consistent.\n\u2022 Context: Same plateau surface as A; appear to converge toward ring-ditch.\n\u2022 Feature match: Causeways or boundary ditches associated with geoglyph complexes; could also be modern survey or extraction lines but no modern road signature on DEM.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeology (causeway/road network).\n\nAnomaly C\n\u2022 Geometry: Single very straight ditch >200 m, constant width.\n\u2022 Context: Runs along gentle slope margin; orientation aligns with one of the B-lines, suggesting planned layout.\n\u2022 Alternative: Natural gully unlikely\u2014straightness and lack of branching.\nClassification: PROBABLE linear causeway or boundary.\n\nAnomaly D\n\u2022 Geometry: Irregular circles, asymmetrical, variable depth.\n\u2022 Context: Occupy small swale leading downslope; match local erosional hollows.\nClassification: UNLIKELY archaeology \u2013 probably erosional sink features.\n\nAnomaly E\n\u2022 Geometry: Irregular ridge, follows slope grain; no closed form or straight edges.\nClassification: NATURAL topographic ridge.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Synthesis\n\u2022 The high-confidence ring-ditch (A) sits at the hub of a rectilinear network of probable straight ditches/causeways (B & C). Their orientations are coherent, forming an organised plan typical of late-pre-Columbian geoglyph complexes on interfluvial plateaus of SW Amazonia.\n\u2022 No obvious raised-field gridding or mound-village clusters beyond the central enclosure.\n\u2022 Pattern suggests a single primary ceremonial enclosure with associated processional ways rather than a dispersed village field system.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe imagery reveals a well-defined square/diamond ring-ditch with an interior mound, flanked by a systematic set of straight ditches/causeways. Together these constitute a planned earthwork complex characteristic of pre-Columbian geoglyph traditions. Natural erosional forms are minimal and readily separable. Overall, the evidence strongly supports an archaeological interpretation.\n",

The geometry is unequivocal for the perimeter and very persuasive for the interior features, leaving little doubt of anthropogenic origin.\n",

No obvious road-causeway radiating farther, but the diagonal alignment hints at internal planning.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe imagery reveals at least two large, well-preserved square/rectangular ditch enclosures displaying textbook geometric precision and location on an interfluvial terrace \u2013 all diagnostic of Middle\u2013Late Holocene geoglyph (ring-ditch) sites in Acre and adjacent regions. Other anomalies are either modern land-use traces or natural channels. The cluster suggests a single archaeological complex rather than isolated features.\n",

Their placement on an elevated Tertiary plateau edge, overlooking a meandering river, matches hundreds of known late-Holocene earthwork sites in SW Amazonia. No contradictory natural explanations fit the observed geometry.\n\nOverall interpretation: Highly probable archaeological site comprising multiple interconnected geoglyph features.\n",

Interior Anomalies B & C emanate from the SE corner toward centre, mimicking the radial avenues documented at several Acre/RO geoglyph sites.\n\u2022 Peripheral Anomaly D aligns with the SW edge of Anomaly A, suggesting it may be an outer enclosure or causeway connecting the geoglyph to additional, now-masked features.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe imagery reveals a classic Amazonian geoglyph: a large, near-rectangular ring ditch/embankment situated on a leveled interfluve, with at least two internal straight causeways radiating from one corner. The geometry, context, and arrangement match known late-Pre-Columbian ceremonial/geopolitical enclosures from SW Amazonia. No convincing natural explanations exist for the primary enclosure.\n\nOverall Interpretation: Single large ceremonial/administrative geoglyph with internal avenues; high likelihood of associated features outside the current lidar strip.\n",

The widths, spacing, and right angles argue strongly for intentional engineering. In Amazonia, such patterns are diagnostic of pre-Columbian raised-field agricultural systems or drainage grids associated with complex earth-working societies inhabiting seasonally flooded savannas and floodplains. No obvious habitation mounds or ring ditches are visible within this slice, but the scale and precision indicate a large, organized field system rather than natural processes.\n\nOverall Interpretation: Probable pre-Columbian raised-field agricultural complex with principal drainage/canal axes and subsidiary field parcels. Additional mapping outside this strip is recommended to delimit full extent and search for associated habitation sites.\n",

This spatial pairing\u2014geoglyph on terrace, agricultural features on adjoining floodplain\u2014is a documented pattern in southwestern Amazonia.\n\u2022 No causeways detected linking the two, but the straight trough of Anomaly 4 may represent an eroded remnant.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nAt least one clear geometric enclosure (ring-ditch) exists, accompanied by a large, patterned mound field strongly suggestive of anthropogenic raised-field agriculture. Surrounding features are mostly natural terrace/floodplain morphology, but the co-occurrence of the enclosure and mound field indicates a multi-component pre-Columbian landscape.\n\nOverall interpretation: A probable pre-Columbian occupation zone combining an upland ceremonial/defensive ring-ditch with adjacent floodplain agricultural infrastructure.\n",

Central-north irregular polygonal ditch: NW-to-NE-to-SE straight\u2010ish blue negative anomaly enclosing a 400\u2013500 m wide interior (Center quadrant, extending slightly into NW & NE). Shape: multi-sided polygon, 4\u20135 straight segments, most prominent.\n2. NE border straight N-S ditch: Thin blue line hugging the right edge (NE quadrant). Shape: linear, ca. 600 m long.\n3. Northern border W-E ditch: Horizontal blue depression across the extreme top (NW\u2192NE). Shape: straight.\n4. Cluster of small red mounds (~30\u201340) in the north-central interior of the polygon (Center/N-center). Shape: dot cluster.\n5. SW quadrant set of three thin parallel blue/red stripes trending N-S along the western edge. Shape: sub-parallel lines.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Detailed Analysis\n1. Central polygonal ditch\n\u2003Geometric test: 4\u20135 straight segments, roughly 60\u2013120\u00b0 angles, individual segments up to 350 m. Edges consistent, width uniform (~8\u201312 m). Interior lacks matching ridge, but slight red halo locally suggests earthen bank. Symmetry moderate; corners visible. Natural explanation unlikely (cuts downslope obliquely, ignores drainages). Topographic context: Terrain map shows feature lies mid-slope on a broad shoulder, not in valley bottom; this is consistent with many Amazonian ring-ditch/geoglyph sites placed on well-drained interfluves. Classification: PROBABLE archaeological ring-ditch enclosure.\n\n2. NE border N-S ditch\n\u2003Geometric test: Single perfectly straight segment >600 m, uniform width. Appears to connect with polygon\u2019s eastern side at a right angle, forming a possible larger enclosure or causeway. Cross-cuts slope gradient. No natural channel evident. Classification: PROBABLE archaeological (causeway or larger enclosure side).\n\n3. Northern border W-E ditch\n\u2003Geometric test: Perfectly linear, intersects #2 at right angle, giving two orthogonal sides of a rectangle c. 600\u00d7700 m. Together with #2 these lines frame the polygon in a bigger scheme. Natural drainage unlikely (too straight). Classification: PROBABLE archaeological \u2013 side of large geoglyph or boundary.\n\n4. Interior mound cluster\n\u2003Geometry: Dozens of discrete ~10\u201315 m diameter positive anomalies, loosely but not randomly spaced. Pattern resembles known \"mound villages\" inside ring-ditches. Some are paired with tiny surrounding blue halos (encircling depressions). Context: within enclosure, on stable ground. Alternative natural (treefalls/termite mounds) possible but density and uniform size lean cultural. Classification: PROBABLE archaeological habitation mounds.\n\n5. SW parallel stripes\n\u2003Geometry: Three narrow anomalies run parallel downslope, spacing regular but ends feather out; width <10 m. Located on steeper slope; could be small landslip scarps or modern logging skid trails. No clear geometric enclosure and they align with slope direction. Classification: UNLIKELY archaeological, probably natural/modern disturbance.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Relationships\n\u2022 Ditches #1, #2, #3 join to outline at least two concentric rectilinear enclosures: an inner 4\u20135-sided polygon (#1) and parts of a larger rectangle (>1 km) (#2+3). Angles are near-orthogonal, suggesting planned layout.\n\u2022 Mound cluster (#4) sits centrally within inner ditch, typical of habitation inside fortified ring-ditch villages.\n\u2022 No clear connection of SW stripes (#5) to the main complex.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe imagery reveals a planned, multi-component earthwork complex: a central polygonal ring-ditch enclosing a dense village mound cluster, bordered to the north and east by long straight ditches likely forming a larger rectangular enclosure or causeway system. Geometry, orientation across slope, and internal habitation pattern correspond closely with late pre-Columbian Acre-Bolivia ring-ditch villages. No compelling natural explanations exist for the primary anomalies.\n\nOverall classification: Probable archaeological earthwork site with habitation mounds and associated boundary/causeway features.\n",

Other anomalies are either inconclusive or natural. The site appears positioned on a slight upland margin overlooking a floodplain, matching settlement location preferences seen elsewhere.\n\nRecommended action: Acquire wider lidar coverage to delimit full enclosure and search for additional features; conduct ground verification and shovel-test pits at Anomaly 1.\n",

Along the plateau rim (runs the length of the strip): band of closely spaced, individual red dots forming an organised arc-like chain.\n5. NE-quadrant: diffuse, irregular mosaic of red/blue patches lacking clear geometry.\n\nRelative prominence: #1 strongest, then #2, #3, #4, #5.\n\nPHASE 2 \u2013 ANOMALY ANALYSIS\n\nAnomaly 1 \u2013 Rectangular enclosure (SW)\n\u2022 Geometric test: Sides are perfectly straight, parallel\u2013perpendicular; four right-angle corners. Interior texture looks patterned rather than random.\n\u2022 Paired features: exterior blue (ditch) with interior red (embankment/platform) in several stretches.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Located on the flat upper plateau (white/brown on DEM) \u2013 the preferred setting for Amazonian geoglyphs.\n\u2022 Alternative explanations: Modern agricultural fields are possible, but the scale (hundreds of metres) and earthen appearance differ from tractor plough ridges.\n\u2022 Classification: HIGH CONFIDENCE \u2013 classic square/rectangular geoglyph or ring-ditch.\n\nAnomaly 2 \u2013 Straight linear feature\n\u2022 Geometry: Very straight, uniform width, clear colour polarity (blue centre, red flanks).\n\u2022 Paired ridge+ditch signature suggests a hollow way or causeway with spoil embankments.\n\u2022 Context: Runs along the plateau edge, could link high ground geoglyphs.\n\u2022 Alt. explanation: Lidar scan seam unlikely (pattern continuous, not white). Natural erosion rare to produce such straightness.\n\u2022 Classification: PROBABLE archaeological (causeway or boundary ditch).\n\nAnomaly 3 \u2013 Y-shaped depression\n\u2022 Geometry: Branching, sinuous arms; no equal angles or straight segments.\n\u2022 Looks like a small tributary network incised into slope.\n\u2022 DEM confirms position on mid-slope where runoff collects.\n\u2022 Classification: NATURAL.\n\nAnomaly 4 \u2013 Chain of discrete mounds\n\u2022 Geometry: Individual red pixels, roughly evenly spaced (30-40 m). Slight arc following plateau rim.\n\u2022 Could represent a mound village or series of habitation mounds overlooking slope.\n\u2022 Context: Edge of plateau, common for pre-Columbian habitation.\n\u2022 Alt. explanation: Tree throws/termite mounds unlikely to align so evenly.\n\u2022 Classification: PROBABLE archaeological (mound chain or ring-ditch in-filled segments).\n\nAnomaly 5 \u2013 Irregular patches (NE)\n\u2022 No coherent geometry, highly variable.\n\u2022 Located on lower floodplain (green/blue DEM) \u2013 area prone to cut-and-fill by fluvial processes.\n\u2022 Classification: NATURAL.\n\nPHASE 3 \u2013 PATTERN INTEGRATION\nThe rectangular enclosure (#1) sits about 200 m upslope from the straight linear feature (#2). The linear feature appears to run toward the enclosure\u2019s SE corner, suggesting an access causeway or boundary. The mound chain (#4) parallels the plateau rim and could delimit a broader habitation zone surrounding the enclosure. Taken together they outline a structured, planned landscape typical of late-pre-Columbian earthwork complexes of SW Amazonia.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 FINAL ASSESSMENT\nAt least two anomalies (#1 and #2) show high to good geometric regularity, with a third (#4) plausibly anthropogenic. Their spatial arrangement on a plateau overlooking a slope mirrors known geoglyph precincts. Natural explanations are weak for the sharp-edged rectangle and perfectly straight ditch.\n\nOverall interpretation: The area most likely represents a pre-Columbian earthwork complex comprising a square geoglyph, a straight causeway or boundary ditch, and associated habitation or ceremonial mounds along the plateau edge.\n",

This suggests an integrated settlement system: ring-ditch village on the terrace, linear mounds along the levee, and a built causeway traversing seasonal wetland between them.\n\u2022 Organised pattern \u2013 the straight alignment, repeated circular geometry and regular mound spacing collectively indicate deliberate layout rather than coincidence.\n\u2022 Outstanding features \u2013 the two small perfect circles (Anomaly 4) are the clearest indicators of anthropogenic construction.\n\nOVERALL INTERPRETATION\nThe imagery likely captures a multi-component archaeological landscape consisting of: (1) at least two ring-ditch village enclosures on an interfluve, (2) a straight causeway leading downslope, and (3) a levee-top mound chain that may represent a peripheral habitation zone or cemetery. Some surrounding anomalies are natural fluvial forms, but the geometric elements strongly point to intentional earthworks.\n",

Their shared orientation and constant width imply intentional engineering rather than fluvial incision.  The nearby probable ring ditch (Anom. 3) would fit a settlement or ceremonial enclosure connected by those causeways.  Faint evidence of a second ring (Anom. 4) hints at a clustered site pattern typical of late pre-Columbian occupation.\n\nTaken together, the data suggest a small geoglyph complex composed of at least one ring ditch linked by causeways, situated on a gentle slope above a larger valley.

Faint rectangular enclosure (Anomaly 3)\n\u2022 Geometry: Long straight NW\u2013SE segment and orthogonal corner visible, but southern/western sides irregular and discontinuous.\n\u2022 Internal consistency weak; edges partly follow micro-relief visible in DEM.\n\u2022 Likely relict paleochannel or soil variation line rather than built earthwork.\n\u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY.\n\nD.

While ancillary rectilinear traces are faint, the geometry and context of the two rings are persuasive.\nOverall interpretation: Probable ring-ditch settlement complex with at least one associated causeway-style water feature.\n",

Its geometry, paired rim/ditch signature, and relief contrast support an anthropogenic origin, though its floodplain setting is slightly atypical for classic plateau geoglyphs. The remaining linear features are probably modern cuts or natural gullies. Overall, the evidence points to a single probable archaeological feature rather than an extensive site complex.\n",

The geometry, continuity, and junction symmetry strongly support an archaeological origin. Large circular depressions and scattered mounds are judged natural and unrelated.\n\nOverall interpretation: Probable pre-Columbian causeway/ditch network (road or canal) with at least one platform node, similar to late-Holocene geoglyph/earthwork traditions of Acre and adjacent regions.\n",

Central circular depression\n\u2022 Geometry: Outline approximates a circle; interior uniformly low (blue). Red pixels form a discontinuous but coherent ring on its outer margin.\n\u2022 Symmetry: Fairly even radius; no obvious breaks or meanders.\n\u2022 Paired features: Blue ditch with adjacent red berms implies excavation and up-cast soil.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Situated on the flat brown/grey plateau interior \u2013 ideal location for ring ditches/geoglyphs rather than erosional hollows.\n\u2022 Alternative processes: Solution sinkholes possible but rarely produce such uniform rim berms.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeological ring-ditch.\n\nA2.

Their comparable morphology and proximity (c. 300-400 m apart) suggest they form part of the same ceremonial/settlement complex. No obvious causeways link them, but later survey at finer scale is warranted. Other anomalies are either natural or low-confidence.\n\nOverall interpretation: The imagery most plausibly represents a small ring-ditch complex (one large, one small) typical of late pre-Columbian earth-work traditions.\n",

Other anomalies appear natural or artefactual.  No broader alignment or raised-field grid detected.  Overall the imagery points to a single but definite earthwork complex on an upland promontory.\n\nOverall Site Interpretation: Probable geoglyph/ring-ditch enclosure with entrance causeway on plateau edge; isolated rather than part of large engineered landscape.\n",

Their identical width, sharpness, great linearity and indifference to topography strongly suggest an engineered transportation or water-management system, comparable to pre-Columbian Amazonian causeways and canals documented on seasonally inundated slopes.\nNo enclosure or platform is visible, but the presence of a straight multi-kilometre feature crossing elevation zones implies the vicinity of a larger site complex outside the current frame.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 FINAL ASSESSMENT\nThe dataset reveals a deliberate, extensive linear earthwork \u2013 most parsimoniously interpreted as a pre-Columbian causeway/canal \u2013 accompanied by at least two subsidiary branches. The absence of convincing geometric enclosures in the present strip lowers certainty, yet the clarity of the linear engineering yields a strong archaeological signal.\n\nOverall interpretation: Probable anthropogenic causeway network, likely connecting habitation areas on the upland ridge to resources downslope.\n",

Shape, scale, topographic position and construction technique are all consistent with Amazonian geoglyphs (A.D. 1-1250). No convincing evidence for purely natural origin is present.

Prominence: highest because of the sheer concentration of positive anomalies contrasting with the surrounding blue floodplain.\n2. Centre-right (east of the river confluence, about halfway up the image): faint doughnut-shaped pattern, c. 180 m diameter \u2013 thin red rim enclosing a blue interior.  Prominence: second.\n3. North-east quadrant: narrow red linear ridge, 300 m long trending NW-SE on the flank of a larger slope.  Prominence: third.\n4. South-west quadrant: isolated rectangular patch of red, c. 120 \u00d7 80 m.  Prominence: fourth.\n5. North-west and south-east corners: broad red hill-tops \u2013 large scale, probably natural, lowest archaeological interest.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Detailed Analysis\nA. Central-west mound field\n\u2022 Geometry: individual points; no straight edges but the dots are fairly evenly spaced (30-60 m apart) and occur in a rough oval cluster.\n\u2022 Paired features: each dot is solely positive relief; surrounding pixels are neutral/blue \u2013 consistent with small earthen mounds without ditch.\n\u2022 Topographic context: terrain map shows uniform dark blue (low floodplain) <3 m relief; far from upland plateau \u2013 classic setting for pre-Columbian raised-field/mound villages.\n\u2022 Alternative explanations: floodplain natural levee splays are usually linear or lobate, not evenly distributed dots. Modern anthrosols unlikely to give such discrete signatures.\n\u2022 Classification: PROBABLE archaeological (raised-field/mound complex).\n\nB.

Additional probable platform (D) reinforces the anthropogenic interpretation.  Only one surveyed anomaly (C) was judged likely natural.  Overall pattern fits a small ceremonial-residential complex with agricultural infrastructure.\n",

Scattered habitation mounds cluster near the linear ditch. Although a modern linear disturbance cannot be completely ruled out, lack of accompanying positive relief and its negative Z-score signature support a ditch rather than a cut road. Collectively these features suggest a small ring-ditch settlement connected by a causeway with adjacent village mounds.\n",

These three form a coherent archaeological signature typical of late pre-Columbian geoglyph complexes on interfluvial plateaus of south-western Amazonia. No evidence for raised-field agriculture or additional geometric earthworks is present. Overall, the dataset very likely captures a small, single-unit geoglyph site with associated habitation area and connecting infrastructure.\n",

Central-left band (spans NW-to-center): 150-200 very small, discrete, mostly circular red pixels forming a dense, 400 m-wide ribbon running roughly west-east. Stands out the most.\n2. East-central isolated patch (just left of vertical blue ravine): compact, roughly square red area ~40 m across with slight moat-like blue ring.\n3. South-east wedge: broad, faint triangular red high on the upland slope, ~300 m base, not sharply bounded.\n4. Vertical blue trenches (two, one far W, one centre): linear negative anomalies up to 60 m wide, extending N-S through the scene. (Included for completeness even though likely natural.)\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Detailed Evaluation\nA. Central-left band of dots\n\u2022 Geometry: Each point \u22488-12 m diameter, fairly round; spacing semi-regular (30-50 m). Collective shape is a sinuous but coherent ribbon.\n\u2022 Paired features: many points show a tiny blue halo downslope, suggesting mound + borrow pit.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Lies exactly on the break-in-slope between upper plateau (tan) and lower floodplain (green/blue). This is a classic setting for Amazonian bluff-edge mound villages and small terra-preta house platforms.\n\u2022 Alternative natural causes: unlikely; termite mounds rarely display such uniform sizing and linear arrangement; colluvial knolls would not be so discretely separated.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeological \u2013 bluff-edge mound village line.\n\nB. East-central square patch\n\u2022 Geometry: plan-view nearly rectangular (~40\u00d745 m) with crisp corners; surrounding faint blue depression suggests ditch.\n\u2022 Internal consistency: uniform red interior, sharp edge.\n\u2022 Landscape position: On slight bench midway down slope; isolated from natural rills.\n\u2022 Alternative explanations: small landslip hummock would show irregular interior; shape argues against that.\nClassification: HIGH CONFIDENCE \u2013 small square/geometric geoglyph or platform with ditch.\n\nC. South-east wedge\n\u2022 Geometry: diffuse, triangular; margins gradational; no right angles.\n\u2022 Context: Upper slope of plateau, partly merging with natural scarp.\n\u2022 Likely explanation: erosional remnant or colluvial lobe.\nClassification: NATURAL.\n\nD. Vertical blue trenches\n\u2022 Geometry: straight to sinuous, up to 60 m wide, continuous downslope.\n\u2022 These are clearly stream channels/gullies visible in DEM.\nClassification: NATURAL.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Synthesis\nRelations: Feature A forms a 2-km long chain; Feature B sits 400 m east of its eastern terminus \u2013 possible contemporaneous occupation. No obvious causeways or raised fields visible.\n\nOverall Site Interpretation: The scene most plausibly represents a linear village zone of closely spaced habitation mounds arrayed along the bluff edge (Feature A) with at least one larger formal platform or ring-ditch structure (Feature B). Together they fit known late pre-Columbian Amazonian earthwork patterns along seasonally flooded valleys.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Assessment\n\u2022 Two independent geometric anomalies.\n\u2022 Both occur on stable, well-drained terrain ideal for settlement.\n\u2022 No contradictory natural explanation fits all observations.\nConclusion: Probable archaeological complex consisting of bluff-edge mound village and small square geoglyph/platform.\n",

The ring ditch (Anomaly 3) sits 600 m NE of mound cluster 1; causeway 4 appears to connect them via valley crossing. Pattern evokes a multi-component site: central ceremonial enclosure (3), adjacent residential mound field (1), linked by engineered routes (2 & 4). Combined, these features are characteristic of late Holocene Amazonian earthwork complexes on interfluve plateaus.\n\nOverall Interpretation: The imagery reveals an organized archaeological landscape with at least one ring ditch/geoglyph, a mound village, and ancillary causeways/embankments. Natural explanations for straight lines and concentric ditch are unlikely.\n",

The geometric precision, regular spacing, and topographic setting strongly favour a cultural origin over natural or modern industrial explanations for the majority of anomalies. One long straight depression is probably modern and is excluded. Overall, the site strongly indicates a pre-Columbian settlement nucleus with engineered agricultural surfaces.\n",

Least prominent of the three.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Detailed Evaluation\nAnomaly A (cluster of circular mounds)\n\u2022 Geometric test: Each element is near-perfectly circular (diameter ~20\u201330 m) with consistent size; spacing between centres fairly even (~40\u201350 m). Blue ring immediately around each indicates flanking shallow ditch or lower terrain\u2014classic mound+ditch pairing.\n\u2022 Internal consistency: All mounds similar height (\u2265+3 \u03c3) and diameter, forming a coherent cluster.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Terrain DEM shows the area lies on a broad valley/floodplain (dark blue) at the foot of an upland slope. Discrete circular high spots in a low, flat plain are unlikely to be erosional remnants.\n\u2022 Alternative explanations: Natural termite mounds can be circular but usually far smaller (<5 m), much more numerous, and lack uniform spacing. Floodplain levees form elongated ridges, not isolated circles.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeological feature \u2013 most consistent with a pre-Columbian mound village or raised-field habitation islets.\n\nAnomaly B (arcuate ridge)\n\u2022 Geometric test: Arc approximates part of a circle, but edges are irregular; no matching opposing arc to complete a ring. Width and relief vary.\n\u2022 Internal consistency: Ridge surface fragmented; not a full enclosure.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Sits on same floodplain, could be a relict natural levee or meander scroll.\n\u2022 Alternative explanations: Cut-off channel levee is plausible; absence of interior hollow argues against ring ditch.\nClassification: UNLIKELY archaeological \u2013 probably natural levee/meander.\n\nAnomaly C (scattered mid-strip spots)\n\u2022 Geometric test: Small (<1 \u03c3) irregular blotches, no symmetry, no regular spacing.\n\u2022 Context: Occur on mid-slope (green/yellow in DEM) where shallow landslip rubble and tree-fall pits common.\nClassification: NATURAL.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Iteration complete; no further strong candidates observed.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nOnly Anomaly A exhibits clear geometric regularity and mound-ditch pairing; it is spatially discrete and located on a floodplain setting typical for artificial habitation mounds or raised-field nuclei seen elsewhere in SW Amazonia. No connecting causeways or linear geoglyphs detected. Overall the evidence points to a single small mound complex rather than an extensive geometric earthwork landscape.\n\nOverall Interpretation: The study area likely hosts a pre-Columbian floodplain mound cluster (probable village or agricultural raised field nuclei) at its southern end. Other observed anomalies are best explained by natural fluvial processes.\n",

Dense field of pin-point red highs scattered over the central plateau area; forms a roughly oval patch ~60 % of visible sector.\n3. Subtle, roughly rectangular outline (slightly brighter rim, depressed interior) immediately south-east of the midpoint of the linear ridge.\n4. Sinuous blue depression bordering the very bottom edge of the data wedge; continuous, branching pattern.\n5. Shorter linear segment, parallel and ~150 m south-east of anomaly 1, visible only in the extreme east corner.\nRelative prominence ranking: 1 (most), 2, 4, 3, 5.\n\nPHASE 2 \u2013 DETAILED ANALYSIS\nAnomaly 1 \u2013 Straight linear ridge/causeway\n\u2022 Geometry: perfectly straight over >500 m; constant width; no meanders.\n\u2022 Edges: crisp; internal red core bounded by narrow blue ditch-like lows \u2192 ridge flanked by shallow cut.\n\u2022 Symmetry: present (ditches both sides).\n\u2022 Pairing: ridge+ditch pair typical of Amazonian causeways.\n\u2022 Topographic context: lies on high, level plateau (tan/white on DEM) \u2013 classic setting for pre-Columbian roads linking mound clusters.\n\u2022 Alternative natural explanations: unlikely; no tectonic or fluvial processes create such straight, level ridges.\nClassification: HIGH CONFIDENCE archaeological (causeway).\n\nAnomaly 2 \u2013 Field of small positive mounds\n\u2022 Geometry: individual dots ~1\u20132 px diameter, but cluster is oval; density fairly even.\n\u2022 Regularity: while individual highs are point-like, spacing is semi-regular (~20\u201330 m) suggesting cultural layout, not random termite mounds.\n\u2022 Paired features: many have blue halos (ditch pits) indicating built mounds.\n\u2022 Context: confined to summit of plateau, away from floodplain; fits mound village/residential terra-preta locus seen in other Amazonian sites.\n\u2022 Alternative: termite mounds possible, yet distribution resembles human habitation grid more than biological patchiness.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeological (mound village field).\n\nAnomaly 3 \u2013 Subtle rectangular enclosure\n\u2022 Geometry: faint 4-sided outline ~120 \u00d7 90 m; sides straight, corners ~90\u00b0.\n\u2022 Internal consistency: interior largely neutral (white) suggesting ditched perimeter rather than platform.\n\u2022 Context: on same plateau very near causeway; typical for plazas or stockade ditches.\n\u2022 Weakness: very low Z-score amplitude; visibility borderline.\nClassification: PROBABLE but low-to-moderate confidence (possible plaza or ring ditch).\n\nAnomaly 4 \u2013 Sinuous depressed channel\n\u2022 Geometry: meandering, dendritic; variable width; no symmetry.\n\u2022 Topographic context: coincides with colour-coded low area (green/blue); clearly a drainage network.\nClassification: NATURAL.\n\nAnomaly 5 \u2013 Secondary short linear ridge\n\u2022 Geometry: straight but short (~120 m) and less pronounced than Anomaly 1.\n\u2022 Possibly a spur linking mound sector to main causeway.\n\u2022 Confidence limited by partial visibility.\nClassification: UNLIKELY/NON-DIAGNOSTIC; could be erosional scarp fragment or cultural spur \u2013 remains tentative.\n\nPHASE 3 \u2013 PATTERN SYNTHESIS\n\u2022 Causeway (Anom 1) passes directly toward the mound field (Anom 2) and terminates near the faint rectangular enclosure (Anom 3) \u2013 typical integrated site plan (road-plaza-house clusters).\n\u2022 No anomalies on the surrounding slopes or floodplain, reinforcing idea of a discrete occupational node on an interfluve ridge.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 FINAL ASSESSMENT\nThe combination of a long, perfectly straight ridge-ditch causeway, an extensive, ordered mound scatter, and a possible ditched plaza strongly match known late-pre-Columbian \u201cring-ditch village\u201d or \u201ccauseway-linked village\u201d complexes documented on southern Amazon uplands. Natural explanations fail to account for the straightness and spatial organisation.\nOverall interpretation: The imagery most likely represents a pre-Columbian village complex comprising a plaza or ring ditch, a residential mound field, and a straight causeway connecting components or linking to another, off-frame site.\n",

The absence of additional geometric structures suggests a lone enclosure rather than a complex. Overall, the evidence supports the presence of an archaeological earthwork with good confidence, set on a stable, gently sloping landscape above floodplain level.\n",

Modern linear disturbances are also present but do not detract from the archaeological interpretation.\n\nOverall interpretation: Probable pre-Columbian geoglyph/ring-ditch complex comprising one high-confidence and one probable rectangular earthwork on an upland interfluve.\n",

Their consistent width, sharp corners and disregard for natural drainage strongly favour an anthropogenic origin, most consistent with pre-Columbian raised causeways, defensive walls or parcel boundaries.

While the absence of an obvious enclosure lowers certainty, the morphological match to known Amazonian causeways leads to a moderate-to-high probability of archaeological significance.\n",

Such right-angle, long, straight cuts on an upland surface are characteristic of anthropogenic earth-moving rather than fluvial or erosional processes.  While a modern origin (survey cut, drainage ditch, forestry road) cannot be completely excluded, the expression as depressions rather than raised tracks, and the absence of associated modern infrastructure in the DEM, tip the balance toward a pre-Columbian engineered landscape \u2013 possibly components of a larger geoglyph or road network whose enclosed shapes lie outside this image frame.\n\nNo enclosed squares or circles are visible here, so the investigated portion most likely represents causeways connecting larger geoglyph enclosures located nearby.\n\nOverall Site Interpretation: Linear orthogonal ditch/causeway network on an upland plateau \u2013 probable archaeological feature, but further imagery is required to locate associated ring ditches or plazas and to rule out recent anthropogenic cuts.\n",

The probable raised-field zone (Anom-2) lies downslope to the south-west but within 500 m of the ring, suggesting an economic link between habitation enclosure on the plateau and cultivation plots on the gentle lower slope. No obvious formal causeway connects them, but distance is short. Other anomalies do not form a coherent pattern.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 OVERALL INTERPRETATION\nThe imagery most strongly indicates a single, well-formed circular ring ditch typical of late pre-Columbian domestic/ceremonial enclosures of south-western Amazonia, with a possible adjacent raised-field agricultural zone. No extensive geoglyph complex or large rectangular enclosures are present. Site likely represents a small village ring with limited agricultural modifications rather than a major ceremonial centre.\n",

While not every red spot is cultural, the combination, geometric regularity and topographic position on a plateau edge match known late-pre-Columbian Amazonian earthworks. No large square or rectangular geoglyphs are evident; the site likely represents a mound village with adjacent ring-ditch enclosure and a possible causeway.\n\nSite interpretation: Probable late pre-Columbian village complex with ring-ditch enclosure and linear access earthwork established on an upland interfluve overlooking a river valley.\n",

NE quadrant, ~10 % from top edge: two very straight, parallel E\u2013W blue (negative) lines on otherwise speckled, flat plateau surface. Prominence: highest because geometry stands out against random noise.\n2. NE quadrant, just south of anomaly 1: three straight blue segments that form two clear right angles suggesting an incomplete rectangle. Prominence: second.\n3. SE quadrant, right-hand edge: long straight N\u2013S blue depression that appears to continue the east side of anomaly 2. Prominence: third.\n4.

This pattern matches classic Acre-style Amazonian geoglyphs (large square or rectangular ditched enclosures sometimes with attached roadways). No other coherent pattern elsewhere.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe data reveal one convincing square/rectangular ditched enclosure on the plateau, accompanied by straight linear depressions that probably represent associated causeways. The remainder of the scene shows natural drainage and slope processes. Overall, the evidence supports the presence of an archaeological earthwork complex, though visibility is faint and partly incomplete.\n",

Anomaly B (upper half, mainly NW & NE): A network of straight to gently curving narrow blue depressions that intersect at nearly equidistant nodes, dividing the surface into a loose grid of four- to six-sided polygons. The nodes show small red mounds. Very extensive, visually prominent.\n3. Anomaly C (extreme SW corner): Three short, parallel linear red-blue couplets oriented NW-SE.

NW): Dense scatter of small, isolated red pixels (\u22641-2 px) without obvious pattern.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Detailed Evaluation\nAnomaly A\n\u2022 Geometric test: Two sides are straight, uniform in width, and meet at ~110\u00b0. The missing sides are not clearly visible but the preserved edges suggest a rectilinear enclosure 130\u2013180 m across.\n\u2022 Feature match: Rectangular enclosures with external banks/ring ditches are classic Amazonian geoglyphs.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Sits on upper slope/plateau (yellow-tan on DEM) above the flood-plain.

The other anomalies lack convincing geometry or are easily explained by natural or modern processes. There is no observable alignment between anomalies that would indicate an integrated site plan (e.g., causeways).

A flight-line seam would be visible on DEM as an abrupt tonal change, which is not present.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeological causeway/canal (straightness strongly favors cultural origin, but absence of associated enclosure keeps it just below \u201chigh confidence\u201d).\n\nAnomaly 2 \u2013 Curved branching depression\n\u2022 Geometry: smooth constant-width curve, connects orthogonally to Anomaly 1, retains width and depth along its arc.\n\u2022 Context: same low terrace surface; the connection pattern resembles a junction or spur in known raised causeway networks.\n\u2022 Alternative explanations: would be an unlikely natural rill because curvature is regular and there is no downstream continuation.\nClassification: PROBABLE archaeological (spur of the same causeway system).  Slightly lower certainty than Anomaly 1 because straightness test is weaker.\n\nAnomaly 3 \u2013 Circular hollow (lower-left)\n\u2022 Geometry: irregular perimeter, mottled fill, no evidence of paired ridge.\n\u2022 DEM shows it as a markedly lower pocket (dark blue), consistent with an oxbow pond or seasonal pond.\nClassification: NATURAL.\n\nAnomaly 4 \u2013 Horizontal thin line (mid-height)\n\u2022 Geometry: razor-thin, coincides with tonal break visible on both images \u2013 typical of a lidar flight-line seam or tiling artefact, not a genuine terrain feature.\nClassification: NATURAL / DATA ARTEFACT.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Iteration completed (no additional convincing anomalies beyond random noise speckling).\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final assessment\nThe two coherent linear depressions (Anomalies 1 & 2) appear to form a T-junction element of a constructed causeway or drainage canal, a motif common in late pre-Columbian engineering on Amazonian flood-plains.  No ring ditches, mounded villages, or raised-field blocks are visible within this narrow strip, so the larger site cannot be fully characterised; however, the presence of a straight engineered line with a branching spur strongly suggests human landscape modification.\n\nOverall interpretation: The scene most likely contains part of a pre-Columbian causeway/canal network crossing a low terrace, but the evidence is confined to linear features; without accompanying enclosures the certainty is moderate rather than definitive.\n",

Intersection node: small, slightly broader depression where lines meet, vaguely square.\n4. Lower-centre faint line: very subtle, sub-parallel to the main diagonal.\n5. Background red/blue speckling: scattered point highs & lows, no coherent shapes.\n\nPHASE 2 \u2013 INDIVIDUAL ANALYSES\nA. Main diagonal line\n\u2022 Geometry: >1 km straight run with only two gentle angular kinks; uniform width (c.8\u201310 m in DEM scale).  \n\u2022 Symmetry & edge regularity: edges crisp, parallel, no branching dendrites.  \n\u2022 Paired ridge/ditch: only a single depression visible, but continuous.  \n\u2022 Topographic context: cuts downslope across a west-facing hillside (blue low at top \u2192 brown high at bottom). Such cross-slope straightness is atypical for natural drainage that normally follows maximum slope.  \n\u2022 Alternative explanations: logging skid trail or modern track possible, yet L-band surveys often show these as elevated berms, not deep continuous cuts.  \n\u2022 Classification: PROBABLE anthropogenic linear earthwork (causeway/canal/ditch).\n\nB.

Their continuity and uniform width over hundreds of metres match known pre-Columbian causeways/canals used on slopes to connect habitation mounds or manage water. No ring ditches or mound clusters are visible within this narrow strip, but the linear system itself is diagnostic in many Amazonian archaeological landscapes.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 OVERALL INTERPRETATION\nEvidence points to a purpose-built linear earthwork system, most plausibly a ditched causeway or canal traversing a hillslope and intersecting at right angles with a cross-cut. The absence of obvious natural drainage signatures and the engineered straightness favour an archaeological origin, though a recent forestry road cut cannot be entirely excluded without ancillary data.\n\nFinal classification: PROBABLE archaeological linear earthworks.\n",

The straight linear cut (Anomaly 1) strengthens the possibility of anthropic modification of the landscape, yet its exact age/function is uncertain. Other anomalies appear natural. Overall, the imagery suggests a probable single ring-ditch site with an associated linear earthwork, but the density of diagnostic features is low.\n",

No ring ditches or geometric earthworks are evident; the site most plausibly represents a small mound village rather than a large geoglyph complex.\n\nOverall interpretation: Study area is chiefly natural topography (valley with flanking plateaus). Within the eastern plateau a probable pre-Columbian mound village (~200 m across) is detected.\n",

Central circular feature\n   \u2022 Geometry: virtually perfect circle; crisp edge; interior uniformly depressed; a thin ring of slightly elevated rim visible.\n   \u2022 Symmetry: high; no obvious breaks or openings.\n   \u2022 Paired ridge/ditch: yes \u2013 low interior (ditch or pond) + narrow high rim (bank).\n   \u2022 Topographic context (DEM): situated on brown/tan upland surface \u2013 i.e. on a plateau, away from floodplain.\n   \u2022 Interpretation: Matches well with ring-ditch geoglyphs known from Southwestern Amazonia, though the entire interior is the ditch rather than a ditch encircling a flat platform. Some ring ditches were later deepened as reservoirs/borrow-pits, producing this signature.\n   \u2022 Alt. natural explanations: isolated sinkhole possible but karstic ground is unlikely on this basaltic plateau; volcanic maars absent regionally.\n   \u2022 Classification: PROBABLE archaeological (ring-ditch or borrow-pit).\n\n2. SW\u2013NE diagonal line\n   \u2022 Geometry: ruler-straight for >500 m; constant width; entirely blue (cut feature).\n   \u2022 Paired ridge/ditch: no raised flanks visible \u2013 just a cut.\n   \u2022 Topography: crosses plateau slopes without regard to contour; not following a drainage.\n   \u2022 Interpretation: Straightness favours anthropic origin (historic or modern road / survey cut / drainage ditch). Pre-Columbian causeways are usually embanked (red) rather than incised (blue), so a modern cut slightly more likely.\n   \u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY pre-Columbian; likely modern anthropic.\n\n3. N\u2013S line in SE quadrant\n   \u2022 Geometry: short straight segment; intersects #2 at near-right angle; similar width and colour.\n   \u2022 Likely part of same linear network as #2.\n   \u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY pre-Columbian; probably modern.\n\n4. Irregular red/blue clusters (NW)\n   \u2022 Geometry: amorphous, dendritic; follows micro-relief.\n   \u2022 Interpretation: natural tree-throw mounds, termite mounds, or erosion pockets.\n   \u2022 Classification: NATURAL.\n\nPHASE 3 \u2013 PATTERN REVIEW\n\u2022 The two straight incised lines (#2 and #3) intersect close to the central ring-ditch but do not form part of it; they probably represent a later intrusion (road/drain) unrelated to the prehistoric feature.\n\u2022 No additional geometric enclosures detected.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nThe scene contains one convincing circular earthwork situated on an upland surface \u2013 a setting typical of geoglyph-rich regions in SW Amazonia. Superimposed on it is a straight, likely modern cut and several natural micro-relief patches. Taken together the evidence points to a single probable pre-Columbian ring-ditch site subsequently disturbed by modern works.\n",

Confidence medium\u2013high.\n\nAnomaly 2 \u2013 Linear groove with red shoulders\n\u2022 Geometry: 120 m long, \u226415 m wide, orientation roughly parallel to stripe axis; edges somewhat irregular.\n\u2022 Symmetry/regular angles: No clear straightness throughout; slight meander.\n\u2022 Paired ridge & ditch?: Yes, but ditch is asymmetric and deep \u2013 suggests water-cut channel.\n\u2022 Context: Lies on gentle slope descending into small hollow seen in DEM; matches head-water erosion gully.\n\u2022 Classification: NATURAL (drainage incision). Confidence high.\n\nAnomaly 3 \u2013 Broad sinuous depression at valley margin\n\u2022 Geometry: >200 m, winding, branching; blue core with red levees.\n\u2022 Symmetry: None; classic meander pattern.\n\u2022 Context: Exactly at break of slope into lower floodplain (DEM rainbow colours).\n\u2022 Alternatives: None needed.\n\u2022 Classification: NATURAL river/stream channel. Confidence very high.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Iteration\nRemaining speckled red points across plateau are random, lack coherent geometry, and are discounted as termite mounds or tree-throw microrelief.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nOnly one feature (Anomaly 1) shows convincing anthropic geometry. No aligned roads or associated mound clusters are visible. If genuine, it may represent an isolated pre-Columbian ring ditch geoglyph positioned on a small interfluve plateau. The absence of additional geometric earthworks lowers overall certainty, yet the circular moat-and-bank pairing is difficult to ascribe to natural processes.\n\nOverall Interpretation: The dataset contains one probable archaeological earthwork (ring ditch). Other anomalies are natural drainage. Site likely represents a single-component circular geoglyph without extensive surrounding settlement infrastructure.\n",

No other definite alignments observed. Their presence on the same plateau surface suggests a localized anthropogenic complex (ring-ditch habitation with possible causeway) but evidence is limited.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe dataset shows one convincing ring-ditch and one probable straight earthwork situated on a plateau shoulder\u2014both typical of late pre-Columbian earthworks in SW Amazonia. Other anomalies lack diagnostic geometry and are likely natural. Overall, the area is a candidate archaeological locus but additional lidar coverage and ground truthing are required.\n",

No additional geometric enclosures detected nearby, but this pairing (ring + causeway) fits known late pre-Columbian settlement layouts in Acre state.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nAt least two discrete, well-formed geometric anomalies (circular enclosure and straight causeway) strongly suggest a cultural landscape rather than isolated natural quirks. The context on a lightly dissected interfluve plateau matches the preferred locations of Amazonian earthworks. Further lidar examination beyond the current cut-off is recommended, but current evidence supports an archaeological interpretation.\n",

Individual bumps are roughly circular.\n\u2022 Paired ridge/ditch: No systematic ditch halo; slight surrounding blue halo at some points suggests borrow pits.\n\u2022 Topographic context: Lies on the lowest part of the landscape (blue on DEM), a seasonally flooded valley floor adjacent to a small sinuous stream.\n\u2022 Feature match: Pattern and setting match known Amazonian artificial mound fields (village mounds or raised habitation platforms) situated on floodplains for flood avoidance.\n\u2022 Alternative: Termite mounds or natural levee splays. Termite fields normally show more regular hexagonal spacing and occur on well-drained uplands, not in a flooded swale.\n\u2022 Classification: PROBABLE (mound village/raised habitation). Confidence medium-high.\n\n2. SE cluster\n\u2022 Geometric test: Similar small discrete bumps with occasional blue halos. No coherent larger geometry.\n\u2022 Context: Also on valley bottom but nearer the transition to gentle slope (green DEM).\n\u2022 Match: Could be outlying mound group or agricultural raised fields in very eroded state.\n\u2022 Classification: PROBABLE (subsidiary mound field). Confidence medium.\n\n3. NE scatter\n\u2022 Test: Few, widely spaced bumps; no pattern.\n\u2022 Context: Mid-slope (green\u2013yellow DEM); away from floodplain.\n\u2022 Match: Less typical for habitation mounds; could be termite mounds or tree-related microtopography.\n\u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY archaeological. Confidence low.\n\n4. SW scatter\n\u2022 Test: Very sparse; no clustering; sits on gentle slope adjoining a palaeo-channel levee.\n\u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY archaeological \u2013 probably natural levee remnants.\n\n5. NW isolated points\n\u2022 Test: Isolated on upland bench, no organisation.\n\u2022 Classification: NATURAL.\n\nPHASE 3 \u2013 PATTERN REVIEW\nOnly the central and SE clusters show clear spatial coherence. Both lie along the modern/wet-season drainage line, suggesting intentional placement on slight natural rises within the floodplain. No evidence of geometric geoglyphs, roads, or raised-field gridding. Pattern most closely fits dispersed mound villages similar to those documented in the Bolivian and Acre savannas, but here in a more forested valley.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nThe imagery reveals a probable anthropogenic mound complex concentrated in the valley floor, likely representing habitation mounds built to remain above seasonal inundation. No large geometric earthworks (ditches, squares, circles) are present. Overall the evidence supports a moderate likelihood of archaeological origin for the main cluster, with surrounding anomalies probably natural.\n",

They are not obviously connected; spacing suggests separate, possibly sequential occupations rather than a planned complex. No alignments or connecting causeways noted.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe presence of a well-formed oval ring ditch with interior mound on an upland shoulder is a classic signature of late pre-Columbian Amazonian ring-ditch settlements. The second, smaller circle strengthens the archaeological signal, though the rest of the scene appears geomorphically natural. Overall, the dataset likely captures at least one definite archaeological feature (ring-ditch enclosure) with a secondary, probable smaller feature nearby.\n",

Confidence medium.\n\nAnomaly B\n\u2022 Geometry: Clear right-angle symmetry; arms of equal length (~same Z-score intensity); interior white zone implies level floor.\n\u2022 Paired features: Depressed ditch (blue) possibly surrounded by slight red berm.\n\u2022 Context: Located on shoulder between two shallow valleys (light green-yellow in DEM) \u2013 common placement for geoglyph plazas with radiating causeways.\n\u2022 Natural alternative: Confluence of two channels, yet natural channels rarely meet at perfect 90\u00b0 with uniform width.\n\u2192 Classification: HIGH CONFIDENCE geoglyph/plaza with four causeways.\n\nAnomaly C\n\u2022 Geometry: Very straight but broad, flanked by red. Looks like a main valley seen consistently in both maps.\n\u2022 Context: Lies in lowest (blue) sector of DEM; drains the catchment.\n\u2192 Classification: NATURAL valley/river course.\n\nAnomaly D\n\u2022 Geometry: Classic branching dendritic drainage, variable widths and curving.\n\u2022 Context: On sloping upland-to-valley transition.\n\u2192 Classification: NATURAL.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Synthesis\nOnly Anomalies A and B display non-natural geometry. They lie on the same interfluvial plateau and sit ~300 m apart east-west. No evident alignment beyond general proximity, but both could belong to a single occupation landscape: a central plaza (B) with nearby residential mound cluster (A).\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nThe presence of one high-confidence geoglyph (cross-shaped ditch) together with a probable mound village cluster on the same plateau suggests a pre-Columbian site complex rather than isolated natural forms. No other convincing anthropogenic features are observed.\nOverall interpretation: Likely mid-sized geoglyph/plaza with associated habitation mounds, typical of Late Holocene earth-building cultures in SW Amazonia.\n",

SW plateau cluster\n   \u2022 Geometric test: Each red pixel haloed by blue suggests small conical mounds with encircling borrow pits; distribution irregular but density higher than background.\n   \u2022 Feature match: Pattern resembles mound villages documented on Madre de Dios plateau; however spacing is not clearly radial or orthogonal.\n   \u2022 Topography: On interfluve high ground (tan/brown) away from floodplain \u2013 favourable for habitation.\n   \u2022 Alternative: Could be termite mounds or tree-throw micro-topography enhanced by statistical window.\n   \u2022 Classification: UNLIKELY, weak archaeological signature.

Confidence 2/10.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Iteration\nNo further sizeable, convincing anomalies were noticed after re-inspection.\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Final Assessment\nOnly one feature (Anomaly 1) shows coherent geometry, a preferred landscape setting, and classic ring-ditch characteristics. The remainder fit natural explanations tied to drainage or micro-relief variability. No connecting alignments among anomalies were seen. Overall the imagery suggests a single probable ring-ditch geoglyph rather than a complex site.\n\nOverall Interpretation: Probable isolated ring-ditch (possible late Holocene habitation or ceremonial earthwork) on the break-in-slope bordering the valley.\n",

Remaining anomalies show poor geometry or modern/natural signatures and are considered non-archaeological.\n\nPHASE 4 \u2013 OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\u2022 No obvious alignments or connecting causeways between the two rings.\n\u2022 Spatial separation suggests two small independent ring-ditch sites rather than a single large complex.\n\u2022 The setting (plateau top away from floodplain) and morphology match known fortified village enclosures of Acre & Bolivian Amazon.\n\nConclusion: The strip contains at least one, and probably two, prehistoric ring-ditch earthworks. Archaeological potential is therefore high, warranting field verification and higher-resolution lidar focusing on the NE and East-central anomalies.",
